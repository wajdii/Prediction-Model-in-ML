Classifier Model in Machine Learning "LR"

In this example, we have 2 page home.html (it containe the result of prediction when we put different values) and preview.html to see the dataset.
We get the different data "4-text-value" from the "html Form" (post method)
Send values to server flask, get it in array with float values
Put the 4 float value in the model 'LR'
Send the prediction into the specific posistion and see the spesific pictuer
